We identified that mapping every recorded restroom location would not make good use of our chosen data visualisation tool and would require storing an excessive amount of data. With this in mind, we defined a geographic grid consisting of 36,720 cells, each with an area of approximately 3.025 x 10^9m^2. We then repeatedly called the Refuge Restroom API and aggregated the incoming data by grid cell, so that each cell had a total restroom count, plus a count of unisex restrooms, disabled access restrooms and restrooms with a changing table. Due to the uneven distribution of human habitation on the planet, most of the cells had no restrooms and could be discarded. As a result, ~51,000 records in the source database were compressed to 1,334 records in ours.

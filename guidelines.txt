- Keep paragraphs short and include headers and bullet points where appropriate to break the post up into easy to read sections.
- Try to include a conclusion that sums up what you've learnt, what went well, what didn't, and what you'd do differently next time.
- There's no minimum or maximum word count, but try to aim for between 500-1500.
- Send any photos to me (the more, the merrier) and I'll resize them and insert them into the post for you.
